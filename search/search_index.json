Writing these assumptions is done in a simple way by declaring a data schema. Each schema contains as many attributes as columns your data must contain and each column contains as many validations as your data must fulfill. In addition, if a validation fails, it is possible to amend the data on-the-fly , thus keeping the validation flow simple and building a centralized way to declare the main modifications made to the data. In this way, all your raw data is processed to build validated datasets that are homologous to each other. pandantic is intended both to validate data in everyday analysis exercises and to process data in a pipeline in production. Whatever the case, pandantic is a simple and useful tool for developers and data analysts who are comfortable with model-declaration based tools such as django or pydantic . The main advantage of pandantic is to allow to easily deal with incorrect validations by applying amendments, however, it is still a simple and recent tool.
